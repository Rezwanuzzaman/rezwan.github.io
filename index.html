My story
I am a computational biologist specializing in bioinformatics and genomics. I currently work as a Research Scientist on secondment at The Francis Crick Institute, contributing to the Mosaicism and Precision Medicine Laboratory, affiliated with Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London, Uinted Kingdom. I hold a PhD in Biological Sciences with a focus on bioinformatics and virology, during which I conducted extensive research on viral genome evolution and its implications for disease.

Over the years, I have developed and optimized next-generation sequencing pipelines, analyzed multi-omics data, and collaborated with interdisciplinary teams to uncover genetic drivers in pediatric cancer and rare diseases. My work in variant detection, gene fusion analysis, and machine learning-driven biomarker discovery has consistently aimed at translating complex data into actionable clinical insights.
